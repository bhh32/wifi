# Purpose
Linux Network Manager CLI tool (nmci) Wrapper Utilities

There is the cli wrapper utility, wifi_cli, and the GUI wrapper utility, wifi.

## How the utilities work
They both use the library cmd_lib to run the nmci commands needed to add and remove Wi-Fi connections.

## TODO's
I'm working on making the GUI version use the libcosmic version of the iced GUI framework so that it integrates into the new System76 Cosmic DE well. 

Re-tool the look and feel of the GUI.

Possibly make it work with Ethernet connections.
